## Gender Wealth Gap

![](images/luecke_gekauft.jpg){.absolute top="50" left="0" width="100%"}

::: notes
-   Gender wealth gap well established, on average Men own more wealth than women in most countries around the world.
-   Prior research showed that differences in income and employment explain gender differences in wealth
-   But intergenerational transfers might also play a role
-   as does the tax system
-   So both intergenerational transfers and taxes have been neglected in the literature on the gender wealth gap. We want to change that with this project.

-   Share of inherited wealth in aggregate private wealth in Europe around 50-60% [@alvaredo2017]
-   What's the role of intergenerational transfers in gender wealth inequality?
-   Mixed prior ﬁndings
    -   Gender diﬀerence in age and amounts of transfers [@bessière2020]

    -   Hardly any gender differences in **inheritances** in Germany [@leopold2011; @vogel2021a]

    -   But: Prior research based on **survey data**
:::
:::

::: notes
Let me motviate why we should look at intergenerational transfers?

-   Most personal wealth today is inherited. Share of inherited wealth in aggregate wealth is estimated to be around 50-60%.

-   So if private wealth is so much shaped by inheritance it is only logical to ask how intergenerational transfers contribute to the gender wealth gap

-   Prior literature on this topic is limited. For France, Bessiere and Gollac show that men receive transfers at earlier ages and higher amounts leading to a higher accumulation potential

-   Hardly any gender differences are found in Germany for inheritances. Some for gifts.

-   In the US, daughters more likely to receive transfers but no difference in amounts. And increased likelihood only for unmarried daughters.

-   The problem of these study is that they are based on survey data which do not represent the upper end of the wealth distribution well. Because wealth is highly concentrated and power comes along with wealth, it is especially important to know more about gender differences at the top of the wealth transfer distribution.

## Research Question & Contributions

<br>

### Research Question

How does the inheritance and gift tax system in combination with gendered parental transfer behavior shape gender inequalities in wealth?

<br>

### Contributions

-   Focus on the upper part of the transfer distribution

-   Diﬀerentiation between asset types

-   Role of the tax system in shaping gender wealth inequality

::: notes
-   In our study we have two research questions:
    -   Are there gender diﬀerences in parental transfers (inheritances and gifts) in Germany?

    -   How does the German inheritance and gift tax system shape gender inequalities?
-   I think we make three major contributions with this study
    1.  We add to prior literature by looking at the top of the transfer distribution: Upper part important because wealth is related to power
    2.  We differentiate between assets types. It is important to differentiate between asset types because they offer different accumulation potential and translate differently into power. It makes a difference if you inherited a house or a business
    3.  We contribute to the questions how institutions shape wealth inequality by looking at the tax system. here the idea is that men and women benefit differently from tax exemptions because they receive different kind of assets
:::

## Theoretical Background

<br>

### The family as an economic institution

-   Family contributes to wealth concentration via intergenerational transfers [@farrell1993]
-   Family as a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value [@bessière2020]

### Gender inequality in transfers

-   Societal beliefs in gender diﬀerences in entitlements [@lerner1994; @tisch2022]
-   Daughters and sons might receive diﬀerent asset types
-   Unintentional consequences of the tax system (exemptions)

::: notes
What is the theoretical background? We follow the literature in arguing that the family is an important economic institution. The family is a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value. And the family contributes to wealth inequality via intergenerational transfers.

But why should the family treat daughters and sons differently?

Sons and daughters might receive different amounts of transfers, different assets types or they might be more or less likely to receive a transfer at all. This could be because of gendered norms or because of gender differences in characteristics which trigger transfers.

-   There might be societal beliefs in gendered entitlements to transfers. In a recent study Tamara Gutfleisch and I find first evidence for gendered transfer principles although most individuals endorse equality.

-   But even if their are no gendered beliefs, gender difference might arise. Parents might be in a conflict between pursing the principle of equality but also other principles like the exchange or need/altruistic principle. The parents might also want to keep the fortunes together. To this end it might make sense to transfer wealth unequally between children. So it might be the case that there are gender differences in the characteristics which trigger these principles. For example that women are more likely to be in need of financial help and therefore receive more transfers.

-   And last, gender inequality in transfers might also be the product of the tax system. It could be that men benefit more from tax exemptions than women because they receive assets which benefit from larger tax exemptions.

## Country context: <br> German gift and inheritance (tax) law

-   Inheritances
    -   statutory inheritance quota or last will (predeﬁned inheritance + quota)
    -   restricted testamentary freedom → disinheritance possible but statutory share: minimum inheritance of close relatives is half the amount they would have received in absence of a last will
-   Gifts: amount of the gift and the recipient can be freely determined
-   Inheritance tax (not an estate tax)
    -   personal tax exemption (applies to the taxable person): e.g., 400,000 EUR / 10 years for parental transfer
    -   factual tax exemption (applies to the taxable object): business, forest, furniture, family home etc.

::: notes
Before you die you have basically two options: writing a last will or not

-   if you don't write a last will the statutory inheritance quota will be in place with no gender discrimination

-   or you write a last will and can specify the quota or also predefine inheritance. eg you can say that your son should receive the house

-   The testamentary freedom is restricted in Germany. You can disinherit a child but then this child can claim their statutory share from the legal heir. This share is half of the amount they would receive in the absence of a will

-   There are no regulations regarding gift. Thus, the amount and recipient of gifts can be freely chosen

-   What about taxes?

    -   inheritance tax not an estate tax like in the US

    -   gifts and inheritances are treated equally

    -   personal tax exemptions which apply to the taxable person: eg 400,000 Euro every 10 years for each parent

    -   factual exemptions which apply to the taxable object: business, forest land, furniture, family home

-   German inheritance and gift tax data 2007-2020
-   Highly sensitive data → restricted access
-   Cover bequests and gifts for which a tax claim was requested
-   Advantage: Entire population of tax relevant transfers
-   Coverage: 30% of all bequests, accounting for 73% of all transferred wealth above 10,000 EUR in 2010 [@bach2014]

## Methods

-   Descriptive analyses

-   OLS regressions

    -   Dependent variable: Effective inheritance / gift tax rate

    -   Predictor variables

        -   gender (receiver and donor)
        -   asset type (as dummy variables)
        -   age (receiver and donor)
        -   east/west Germany
        -   year

::: notes
Our methods are very straightforward, we look at descriptive tables and graphs. And to explain the gender gap we run OLS regressions.

-   dependent variable are the amount of gifts and inheritance. Due to the skewdness of the data, we transform the data by a percentile rank transformation (for each year separately)

-   second group of dependent variables are the effective tax rate. Inheritance and gift

-   our predictor variables are: gender, asset type, age, east/west, year

::: notes
Let's look at the results. I take you the surprise: we find large gender differences in gifts but not in inheritance but let's look at that in detail. Because in the following I will present a lot of graphs, i want to shortly give an overview what you will see. 1. Gender differences in the absolute number of transfers 2. Gender differences in the absolute amount of transfers 3. Gender differences in the relative amounts and number of transfers 4. Relative numbers of transfers by asset type 5. Then we turn to explanations for the gender differences in amounts. Here we focus on the asset types and the gender of the donor

:::

::: notes
We now turn to the second research question. - To understand how the tax systems affects gender inequality, we calculate the effective tax rate and compare women and men 1. We examine the absolute effective tax rate of women and men across the transfer distribution 2. We examine the absolute effective tax rate by the gender of the donor 3. And we then look at the relative effective tax rates. So we examine how much more women have to pay in taxes compared to men 4. Last, we try to explain the gender tax gap with an OLS regression. We focus here on the asset type and gender of the donor

::: notes
-   To estimate the average gender gap in the amount of gifts and to explain this gap we use OLS regression.
-   Remember that we transformed the amount of gifts to percentiles
-   Model 1 controls only for the years and shows that the gender gift gap amounts to 1.9 percentage points. Thus, sons rank on average about 2 percentage point higher in the transfer distribution than daughters. This is the raw gender gap.
-   Model 2 includes the other predictor variables and shows that gender gap in gift can partly be explained.
-   We find that receiving business wealth or estate reduces the gender gift gap. Indicated by the positive interaction terms
-   Interestingly we find that gender of donor is an important factor: The gender gap increases if the donor is male. Thus, it seems that men gift higher transfers to sons compared to daughters.
-   The other coefficients mostly reflect the importance of business and housing wealth to receive higher transfers. In contrast, Receiving land is negatively related with the percentile rank- at least for women.

::: notes
-   We now look at the results of the regression predicting the percentile rank within the inheritance distribution
-   We do not find significant gender differences in Model 1.
-   Model 2 again shows the importance of business and housing wealth for making it to the top of the inheritance distribution.
-   Model 2 also shows that women bequest more than men to their children, probably because women more likely to survive their husbands

## Conclusion

### Gendered parental transfers

-   Gender differences in total number of inheritances and gift
-   More pronounced for gifts
-   More pronounced for transfers including business and land wealth

### Implicit gender bias in inheritance and gift taxation

-   Men's effective inheritance tax rate 2% lower than women's
-   Men's effective gift tax rate 18% lower than women's

→ Tax system with generous exemptions ampliﬁes gender inequality

::: notes
-   To conclude, we showed that parental transfers are gendered.
    -   daughters receive less gifts and inheritances and the values are also smaller

    -   daughters receive different type of assets

    -   more pronounced for gifts than inheritance

    -   especially male donor seem to be responsible for the gender transfer gap by favoring sons
-   And this gendered transfer behavior results in an implicit gender bias in inheritance but especially gift taxation:
    -   men pay on average about 18% lower gift taxes compared to women. This indicates that the tax system with its generous exemptions ampliﬁes gender inequality.
