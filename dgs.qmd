## Gender Wealth Gap

![](images/luecke_gekauft.jpg){.absolute top="50" left="0" width="100%"}

::: notes
-   Gender wealth gap well established, Men own more wealth than women.
-   Prior research studied how differences in income and employment times relate to gender differences in wealth
-   But intergenerational transfers might also play a role
-   as does the tax system
:::

## Motivation {.larger}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/transfers.jpg){.absolute top="200" left="0" width="400"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Share of inherited wealth in aggregate private wealth in Europe around 50-60% [@alvaredo2017]
-   What's the role of intergenerational transfers in gender wealth inequality?
-   Mixed prior ﬁndings
    -   Gender diﬀerence in age and amounts of transfers [@bessière2020]

    -   Hardly any gender diﬀerences in inheritances in Germany [@leopold2011; @vogel2021a]

    -   But: Prior research based on survey data
:::
:::

::: notes
Why should we look at intergenerational transfers?

-   Most personal wealth today is inherited

-   So it is the logical question, how intergenerational transfers contribute to the gender wealth gap

-   prior literature

-   And because wealth is highly concentrated and power comes along with wealth, it is important to know more about gender differences at the top of the wealth distribution.
:::

## Research Questions & Contributions

<br>

### Research Questions

1.  Are there gender diﬀerences in parental transfers (inheritances and gifts) in Germany?
2.  How does the German inheritance and gift tax system shape gender inequalities?

<br>

### Contributions

-   Focus on the upper part of the transfer distribution

-   Diﬀerentiation between asset types

-   Role of the tax system in shaping gender wealth inequality

::: notes
-   Upper part important because wealth = power
-   Three main contributions
-   we add to prior literature by looking at the top
-   It is important to differentiate between asset types because they offer different accumulation potential and translate differently into power
-   how institutions shape wealth inequality
:::

## Theoretical Background

<br>

### The family as an economic institution

-   Family contributes to wealth concentration via intergenerational transfers [@farrell1993]
-   Family as a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value [@bessière2020]

### Gender inequality in transfers

-   Societal beliefs in gender diﬀerences in entitlements [@lerner1994; @tisch2022]
-   Daughters and sons might receive diﬀerent asset types
-   Unintentional consequences of the tax system (exemptions)

::: notes
In a recent study Tamara and I find first evidence for gendered transfer principles although most individuals endorse equality.

Conflict: parents want to allocate transfers equally but also want to keep the fortunes together

gender inequality in transfers might also be the product of the tax system. It could be that men benefit more from tax exemptions than women.
:::

## Country context: <br> German gift and inheritance (tax) law

-   Inheritances
    -   statutory inheritance quota or last will (predeﬁned inheritances = Vermächtnis and quota)
    -   restricted testamentary freedom → disinheritance possible but statutory share: minimum inheritance of close relatives is half the amount they would have received in absence of a last will
-   Gifts: amount of the gift and the recipient can be freely determined
-   Inheritance tax (not an estate tax)
    -   personal tax exemption (applies to the taxable person): e.g., 400,000 EUR / 10 years for parental transfer
    -   factual tax exemption (applies to the taxable object): business, forest, furniture, family home etc.

::: notes
Before you die you have basically two options: writing a last will or not

## Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/steuererkl.jpg){.absolute top="100" left="0" width="400"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   German inheritance and gift tax data 2020 (in the future: 2007-2020)
-   Highly sensitive data → restricted access
-   Cover bequests and gifts for which a tax claim was requested
-   Advantage: Entire population of tax relevant transfers
-   Disadvantage: Only entire population of tax relevant transfers
-   Coverage: 30% of all bequests, accounting for 73% of all transferred wealth above 10,000 EUR in 2010 [@bach2014]

## Methods

<br> <br> <br> <br>

-   Descriptive analyses

-   OLS with ranked data

    -   Dependent variables:

        1.  Percentile rank in gifts / inheritances

        2.  Effective inheritance / gift tax rate

::: notes
Our methods are very straightforward, we look at descriptive tables and graphs. Because the data are highly skewed, we rank-transform the data.

## Number of parental transfers (2020)

![](images/1a_n_transfers.svg){.absolute top="40" left="0" width="100%"}

::: notes
Sons receive more inheritances and gifts than daughters.

The gender differences more pronounced with gifts.

## Number of transfers by wealth type (2020)

![](images/1d_count_transfers.svg){.absolute top="43" left="0" width="100%"} ::: {.notes}

:::

## Sum of parental inheritance by wealth type (2020)

::: {style="text-align: center"}
Raw inheritance gap: 8,5%
:::

![](images/sum_inheritance_type2.svg){.absolute top="100" left="0" width="85%"}

::: notes
Daughters receive 8.5% less tax relevant inheritances than sons.

Sons received in total more wealth. True for each category.
:::

## Sum of parental gifts by wealth type (2020)

::: {style="text-align: center"}
Raw gift gap: 38,4%
:::

![](images/sum_gift_type2.svg){.absolute top="100" left="0" width="85%"}

::: notes
Daughters receive 38.4% less tax relevant gifts than sons.

Gender differences very high in business wealth.

## Sum of parental (taxable) transfers (2020)

![](images/1a_summe_waffle.svg){.absolute top="45" left="0" width="100%"} ::: {.notes}

::: notes
On the right we have the total amount of wealth transfer. On the left we see the total amount of taxable wealth. That is, the wealth transfer - all exemptions.

Sons received 4 billion more in gifts. but no gender difference in the taxable wealth transfer. this shows that men benefit more from tax exemptions.

Same for inheritances but less pronounced.

## Effective inheritance tax rate by gender (2020)

dag ![](images/output4b_gepr_1.png){.absolute top="45" left="0" width="85%"}

::: notes
No big gender differences in the effective inheritance tax rate. Only at the top of the wealth distribution, daughter have to pay more taxes than sons.
:::

## Effective gift tax rate by gender (2020)

![](images/output4d_gepr_1.png){.absolute top="45" left="0" width="85%"}

::: notes
-   2 percentage points difference in effective tax rate!
-   Gift tax indirectly discriminates women because men benefit from tax exemptions.

## Conlusion

<br>

-   Gender gap in total amounts and number of inheritances and gifts
-   Gender differences more pronounced in gifts compared to inheritances
-   Asset types and gender of donor explain gender transfer gap
-   Tax system ampliﬁes gender inequality
