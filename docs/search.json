    "text": "Motivation\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of inherited wealth in aggregate private wealth in Europe around 50-60% (Alvaredo, Garbinti, and Piketty 2017)\nWhat’s the role of intergenerational transfers in gender wealth inequality?\n\n\n\n\nMixed prior ﬁndings\n\nGender diﬀerence in age and amounts of transfers (Bessière and Gollac 2023)\nHardly any gender differences in inheritances in Germany but gifts (Leopold and Schneider 2011; Vogel et al. 2021; Bach and Mertz 2016)\nBut men receive higher transfers during working life (Bartels, Sierminska, and Schroeder, n.d.)\nMost prior research based on survey data\n\n\n\nLet me motviate why we should look at intergenerational transfers!\n\nMost personal wealth today is inherited. Share of inherited wealth in aggregate wealth is estimated to be around 50-60%.\nSo if private wealth is so much shaped by inheritance it is only logical to ask how intergenerational transfers contribute to the gender wealth gap\nPrior literature on this topic is limited. For France, Bessiere and Gollac show that men receive transfers at earlier ages and higher amounts leading to a higher accumulation potential\nHardly any gender differences are found in Germany for inheritances. Some for gifts.\nIn the US, daughters more likely to receive transfers but no difference in amounts. And increased likelihood only for unmarried daughters.\nThe problem of these study is that they are based on survey data which do not represent the upper end of the wealth distribution well. Because wealth is highly concentrated and power comes along with wealth, it is especially important to know more about gender differences at the top of the wealth transfer distribution."

It is important to differentiate between asset types because they offer different accumulation potential and translate differently into power. It makes a difference if you inherited a house or a business\nWe contribute to the questions how institutions shape wealth inequality by looking at the tax system. here the idea is that men and women benefit differently from tax exemptions because they receive different kind of assets"

    "text": "Theoretical Background\n\nThe family as an economic institution\n\nFamily contributes to wealth concentration via intergenerational transfers (Farrell 1993)\nFamily as a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value (Bessière and Gollac 2020)\n\nGender inequality in transfers\n\nSocietal beliefs in gender diﬀerences in entitlements (Lerner and Mikula 1994; Tisch and Gutfleisch 2022)\nDaughters and sons might receive diﬀerent asset types\nUnintentional consequences of the tax system (exemptions)\n\n\nWhat is the theoretical background? We follow the literature in arguing that the family is an important economic institution. The family is a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value. And the family contributes to wealth inequality via intergenerational transfers.\nBut why should the family treat daughters and sons differently?\nSons and daughters might receive different amounts of transfers, different assets types or they might be more or less likely to receive a transfer at all. This could be because of gendered norms or because of gender differences in characteristics which trigger transfers.\n\nThere might be societal beliefs in gendered entitlements to transfers. In a recent study Tamara Gutfleisch and I find first evidence for gendered transfer principles although most individuals endorse equality.\nBut even if their are no gendered beliefs, gender difference might arise. Parents might be in a conflict between pursing the principle of equality but also other principles like the exchange or need/altruistic principle. The parents might also want to keep the fortunes together. To this end it might make sense to transfer wealth unequally between children. So it might be the case that there are gender differences in the characteristics which trigger these principles. For example that women are more likely to be in need of financial help and therefore receive more transfers.\nAnd last, gender inequality in transfers might also be the product of the tax system. It could be that men benefit more from tax exemptions than women because they receive assets which benefit from larger tax exemptions."

Again we calculate the ratio as men/women\nIn this graph we see the gender ratio in the number of gifts which include the respective asset type.\non the x axis we have now deciles and not year. So the dots represent the average across all deciles\nThe upper left graph shows that men receive two times as many gifts including business assets as women\nFor land, the ratio is even more extreme especially at the top of the distribution\nthe smallest gender differences in the amount of gifts are estates and others"

Thus, sons rank on average about 2 percentage point higher in the transfer distribution than daughters. This is the raw gender gap.\nModel 2 includes the other predictor variables and shows that gender gap in gift can partly be explained.\nWe find that receiving business wealth or estate reduces the gender gift gap. Indicated by the positive interaction terms\nInterestingly we find that gender of donor is an important factor: The gender gap increases if the donor is male. Thus, it seems that men gift higher transfers to sons compared to daughters.\nThe other coefficients mostly reflect the importance of business and housing wealth to receive higher transfers. In contrast, Receiving land is negatively related with the percentile rank- at least for women."

This basically refelects the tax exemptions."

It is important to differentiate between asset types because they offer different accumulation potential and translate differently into power.

Values above 0 indicate that men pay more taxes\nLet’s look at the mean, the upper left panel\nMen pay about 20% less taxes on gifts than women on average but Men pay only 1-3% less taxes on inheritance than women on average\nLet’s move to the median in the upper right panel. Here, At the median a gender tax gap is visible also for inheritance and it amounts to about 18%.\nInterestingly we see that 50% of the receiver of gifts payed no tax at all indicated by missing dots in the upper right panel."

Share of inherited wealth in aggregate wealth is estimated to be around 50-60%.\nSo if private wealth is so much shaped by inheritance it is only logical to ask how intergenerational transfers contribute to the gender wealth gap\nPrior literature on this topic is limited. For France, Bessiere and Gollac show that men receive transfers at earlier ages and higher amounts leading to a higher accumulation potential\nHardly any gender differences are found in Germany for inheritances. Some for gifts.\nIn the US, daughters more likely to receive transfers but no difference in amounts. And increased likelihood only for unmarried daughters.\nThe problem of these study is that they are based on survey data which do not represent the upper end of the wealth distribution well. Because wealth is highly concentrated and power comes along with wealth, it is especially important to know more about gender differences at the top of the wealth transfer distribution."

We follow the literature in arguing that the family is an important economic institution. The family is a place where wealth is produced, circulated, controlled, and assigned value. And the family contributes to wealth inequality via intergenerational transfers.\nBut why should the family treat daughters and sons differently?\nSons and daughters might receive different amounts of transfers, different assets types or they might be more or less likely to receive a transfer at all. This could be because of gendered norms or because of gender differences in characteristics which trigger transfers.\n\nThere might be societal beliefs in gendered entitlements to transfers. In a recent study Tamara Gutfleisch and I find first evidence for gendered transfer principles although most individuals endorse equality.\nBut even if their are no gendered beliefs, gender difference might arise. Parents might be in a conflict between pursing the principle of equality but also other principles like the exchange or need/altruistic principle. The parents might also want to keep the fortunes together. To this end it might make sense to transfer wealth unequally between children. So it might be the case that there are gender differences in the characteristics which trigger these principles. For example that women are more likely to be in need of financial help and therefore receive more transfers.\nAnd last, gender inequality in transfers might also be the product of the tax system. It could be that men benefit more from tax exemptions than women because they receive assets which benefit from larger tax exemptions."

Thus, sons rank on average about 2 percentage point higher in the transfer distribution than daughters. This is the raw gender gap.\nModel 2 includes the other predictor variables and shows that gender gap in gift can partly be explained.\nWe find that receiving business wealth or estate reduces the gender gift gap. Indicated by the positive interaction terms\nInterestingly we find that gender of donor is an important factor: The gender gap increases if the donor is male. Thus, it seems that men gift higher transfers to sons compared to daughters.\nThe other coefficients mostly reflect the importance of business and housing wealth to receive higher transfers. In contrast, Receiving land is negatively related with the percentile rank- at least for women."

Values above 1 indicate that men pay more taxes\nLet’s look at the mean, the upper left panel\nMen pay about 20% less taxes on gifts than women on average but Men pay only 1-3% less taxes on inheritance than women on average\nLet’s move to the median in the upper right panel. Here, At the median a gender tax gap is visible also for inheritance and it amounts to about 18%.\nInterestingly we see that 50% of the receiver of gifts payed no tax at all indicated by missing dots in the upper right panel."
